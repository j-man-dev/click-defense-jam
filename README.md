# Click Defense

Click Defense is a beginner-friendly mouse-based game where you defend a central base by clicking incoming enemies before they reach the center. This project was built as a practice game for a game jam.
## Features

- Minimal, functional gameplay: click enemies before they reach your base
- Simple game loop:  Enemy approaches base→ Player clicks enemy → Enemy disappears → Score increases → Repeat → Game over if enemy reaches base→ Option to restart.
- Score tracking for player feedback
- Structured for easy expansion and learning
